Project Status and Next Steps

--------------------------------------------------
Completed:
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Job Scraping Pipeline:**
   - Implemented in `scripts/job_scrape.py` using the JSearch API.
   - Successfully retrieves finance-related job postings and stores them in the SQLite database.

2. **Database Schema:**
   - The SQLite database (`data.db`) is set up with the required tables (e.g., jobs, parser_results).
   - Database utilities and schema management are handled via scripts in the `database/` and `utils/` directories.

3. **Resume Parsing & Matching:**
   - TF-IDF based similarity scoring is implemented in `scripts/tfidf_parser.py`.
   - SBERT based similarity scoring is implemented in `scripts/sbert_parser.py`.
   - Analysis of each of the similarity scoring methods and deep dive functions (including saving parser results) are available in `scripts/analyze_parsers.py`.

4. **Basic Configuration & Logging:**
   - Configuration is managed in `config.py`.
   - A logging system is established via `utils/logging.py` to support debugging and performance tracking.

Next Steps / Pending Tasks:
--------------------------------------------------
1. **Sector Classification Integration:**
   - **Task:** Integrate the YFinance API to retrieve sector and industry data based on company tickers from job postings.
   - **How-To:** 
     - Use the YFinance API key (set in `config.py`) to fetch classification data.
     - Develop a new module or update an existing one to call the API and update the jobs database with sector details.
   - **Timeline:** Scheduled for Week 3 per project outline.

2. **Forecasting Future Job Postings:**
   - **Task:** Build an ARIMA-based time-series forecasting model to predict job posting trends.
   - **How-To:**
     - Extract historical job posting data from the database.
     - Utilize Python’s `statsmodels` library to create and train an ARIMA model.
     - Integrate forecasting results into the system.
   - **Timeline:** Scheduled for Week 4.

3. **Interactive Visualization Dashboard:**
   - **Task:** Create a dashboard using Streamlit to visualize current job postings, similarity scores, historical trends, and forecasted job opportunities.
   - **How-To:**
     - Develop a Streamlit application that reads data from the SQLite database.
     - Include visual elements like histograms, bar charts, and trend graphs to provide an interactive user experience.
   - **Timeline:** Scheduled for Week 5.

4. **Final Testing & Optimization:**
   - **Task:** Perform comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and performance) on the entire pipeline.
   - **How-To:**
     - Run test cases and benchmark the system.
     - Identify and resolve any bugs or performance bottlenecks.
     - Refine the codebase for stability and scalability.
   - **Timeline:** Scheduled for Week 6.

--------------------------------------------------
Overall Summary:
--------------------------------------------------
The core functionalities—job scraping, database management, and resume-job matching—are fully implemented. The next phases will focus on enhancing the system with sector classification, 
forecasting capabilities, and interactive visualizations, which will provide a complete end-to-end solution for analyzing the finance job market.
